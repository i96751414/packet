"""
Example 1 - Packet:
    Use Packet and a dummy connection to send/receive data.
    For this example, ast serializer will be used, allowing us
    to send bytes/tuple/complex types among others.

    Since we are using Packet, the attributes are not inspected
    so, the attributes will be updated as long as their name are
    the same. This is the reason that Packet only allows basic types.
