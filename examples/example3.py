"""
Example 3 - InspectedPacket:
    Use InspectedPacket to send/receive data.
    Since we are working with InspectedPacket, the data to be loaded
    must match the current data, that is, if attribute "a" is of type int,
    only integers are allowed to be loaded on attribute "a". This is the
    reason why you should avoid using None - there is no a different value
    that can be loaded.

    With InspectedPacket is also possible to send instances of classes, as
    you can see in the following example.

    If you want to send an encrypted InspectedPacket use InspectedSafePacket.
