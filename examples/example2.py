Example 2 - SafePacket:
    Use SafePacket to send/receive encrypted data.
    For this example, json serializer will be used, therefore
    we can only use JSON allowed types.

    As well as Packet, the attributes are not inspected so,
    the attributes will be updated as long as their name are
    the same.
